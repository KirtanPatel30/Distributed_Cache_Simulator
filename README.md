# Distributed Cache Simulator (Systems / Backend)


A local simulator for a distributed in-memory cache system.


## How to Run
python main.py

## What it simulates
- Sharding
- Replication
- LRU / LFU eviction
- TTL expiration
- Cache hit/miss metrics
- Latency simulation

## Why this project
This project models core distributed systems concepts used in real backend
infrastructure such as Redis and Memcached, including sharding, replication,
and eviction strategies.
